# On-demand cat food
I find the lack of Instacart for cat food apps disturbing so I made my own.

There's literally nothing worse than realizing you're out of your cat's favorite gluten and grain free, organic and free-range grilled chicken wet food.

# User Research
I asked 40 proud cat owners about their cat food purchasing habits and woes. Turns out, most of them already shop online but notice that shipping is **extremely slow** and *over-priced*.

>4 out of 5 cat owners worry their cat food purchases won't arrive in the mail on time.

This is a real problem that deserves a real solution.
